# Analysis Pipeline (Placeholder)

This folder will house LLM-based analysis and downstream processing of the scraped GATC data.

Suggested layout:

- `notebooks/`: exploratory analysis, EDA, prototyping (strip large outputs before committing).
- `pipeline/`: production-ready scripts or jobs to process creatives at scale.
- `models/`: prompt templates, configuration files, or lightweight artifacts required for inference.

Feel free to replace this placeholder when the analysis workflow is bootstrapped.
